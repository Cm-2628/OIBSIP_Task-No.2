        <h2> Education</h2>

            As a young boy, Narendranath displayed sharp intellect. His mischievous nature belied his interest in music, 
            both instrumental as well as vocal. He excelled in his studies as well, first at the Metropolitan institution, 
            and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. By the time he graduated from the college, he had acquired a 
            vast knowledge of different subjects. He was active in sports, gymnastics, wrestling and body building. He was 
            an avid reader and read up on almost everything under the sun. He perused the Hindu scriptures like the Bhagvad 
            Gita and the Upanishads on one hand, while on the other hand he studied western philosophy, history and spirituality 
            by David Hume, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Herbert Spencer.

    <h2>Teachings</h2>
    <p>
        Vivekananda returned to India in 1897 amidst warm reception from the common and royal alike. He reached Calcutta after 
        a series of lectures across the country and founded the Ramakrishna Mission on May 1, 1897 at Belur Math near Calcutta. 
        The goals of the Ramakrishna Mission were based on the ideals of Karma Yoga and its primary objective was to serve the 
        poor and distressed population of the country. The Ramakrishna Mission undertook various forms of social service like 
        seminars and workshops, initiating relief and rehabilitation work across the country.

    <h2>Ramakrishna Mission</h2>
    <p>
        His religious conscience was an amalgamation of Sri Ramakrishna’s spiritual teachings of Divine manifestation and his 
        personal internalization of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. He directed to achieve the divinity of the soul by undertaking 
        selfless work, worship and mental discipline. According to Vivekananda, the ultimate goal is to achieve freedom of the soul 
        and that encompasses the entirety of one’s religion.
        Swami Vivekananda was a prominent nationalist, and had the overall welfare of his countrymen topmost in his mind. He urged 
        his fellow countrymen to “Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached”.
